# multitype-defect-detection

multitype-defect-detection contains two different projects.

We use two types defects as a first step for multi-type defects detections.
Durning 2018 Summer, with the help of [ Citrine NextGen fellows in Summer 2018](http://matmodel.engr.wisc.edu/prof-dane-morgan-and-mingren-shen-proud-to-host-9-nextgen-scholars-in-summer-2018/),
we improve the model to three types of defects to further demonstrate the ability of the current model.

## [TwoTypes](https://github.com/uw-cmg/multitype-defect-detection/tree/master/TwoTypes)
codes to detect two types of defects : 111 loops and black dots.


## [ThreeTypes](https://github.com/uw-cmg/multitype-defect-detection/tree/master/ThreeTypes)
codes to detect three types of defects : 111 loops, 100 loops, and black dots.
