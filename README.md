# multitype-defect-detection

Durning 2018 Summer, with the help of [ Citrine NextGen fellows in Summer 2018](http://matmodel.engr.wisc.edu/prof-dane-morgan-and-mingren-shen-proud-to-host-9-nextgen-scholars-in-summer-2018/),
we improve the single type detector model developed in our group([Li, Wei, Kevin G. Field, and Dane Morgan. "Automated defect analysis in electron microscopic images." npj Computational Materials 4.1 (2018): 36.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-018-0093-8)) to three types of defects to further demonstrate the ability of the current model.


## [ThreeTypes](https://github.com/uw-cmg/multitype-defect-detection/tree/master/ThreeTypes)
codes to detect three types of defects : 111 loops, 100 loops, and black dots.
