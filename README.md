# multitype-defect-detection

This is the code written in [ChianerCV](https://chainercv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to do multitype defect detection for TEM images. And it is the code used for our paper [Multi Defect Detection and Analysis of Electron Microscopy 
Images with Deep Learning](https://github.com/uw-cmg/Multitype-Defect-Detection) (URL will be updated after publising). 

# Usuage

After install [ChianerCV](https://chainercv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), you can train and test the codes with the following comands:

'''bash

python train_multi_defect.py

'''



'''bash

python test_multi_defect.py
